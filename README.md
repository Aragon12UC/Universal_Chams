# Universal_Chams
Semi-Universal customisable chams for Unity games. Instructions on how to adapt this to your game are in Main.cs (2 easy steps)

# Injection
Inject using any mono injector. I highly recommend this one because you only need to inject once + will automatically bypass most usermode anti-cheats: https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/unity/485029-unity-neoinjector.html

# Setup
Create a 'StreamingAssets' folder inside of: yourGameFolder/yourGameName_Data/StreamingAssets. Place your asset bundle file in here and name it: 'Universal Chams'.
Alternatively, use the sample asset bundle provided in this repo.
